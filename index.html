                <h3>How to play:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="bold">Press "Start Game" button:</span>
                        This action will hide the landing page navigation and display the game board.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Selecting the Element Cycle:</span>
                        The chosen element cycle will be shown at the top of the game board, 
                        consisting of 5 elements aligned in a row. 
                        This cycle determines the placement of each element relative to the others. 
                        The last element in this row is linked to the first.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Player's Hand:</span>
                        The cards at the bottom of the game board represent your hand. 
                        At the beginning of the game, you will have 5 initial cards. 
                        You can double-click on the cards within your hand. By doing so, 
                        they will be placed as the next top card, but only if the current element cycle allows the placement. 
                        If you can't place a card, you will have to draw a new card.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Draw a Card:</span>
                        In the center of the board, you'll find your deck of cards containing all cards in the game. 
                        A single click on the deck draws a card, which will be added to your hand.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Change Current Element Cycle:</span>
                        If you have to draw a card and the drawn card is a so-called special card (a card that displays a certain cycle), 
                        this card won't be added to your hand. Instead, this card will cause a change in the current element cycle.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Goal of the Game:</span>
                        The primary objective of this game is educational. 
                        It's not about winning or losing. The cards contain information written on top of them. 
                        By placing the cards, you will learn step by step about the different attributes of the elements and their order in 
                        the various element cycles.
                    </li>
