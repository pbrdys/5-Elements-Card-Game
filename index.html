                    <li>
                        <span class="bold primary-color">Prepare the Special Cards</span>
                        The game starts with selecting one of the special cards: Generating, Counteracting, Draining, or Regulating. 
                        This card will determine the initial gameplay mode. Once chosen, the other 3 special cards go back into the deck.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold primary-color">Shuffle and Deal</span>
                        The entire deck will be shuffeled. Deal 5 cards to each player, creating their starting hand. 
                        Starting hand can not include special cards. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold primary-color">Start the Game</span>
                        Reveal the top card from the deck. This card will serve as the starting point for the game. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold primary-color">Draw and Set Card</span>
                        Depending on the current element cycle, you can now set a card on the initial card. If you don't have a card that fits 
                        the current cycle, you can draw a card. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold primary-color">Changing Cycle</span>
                        When you draw a special card, this card doesn't go into your hand - instead it changes the current cycle and you can continue your game.
